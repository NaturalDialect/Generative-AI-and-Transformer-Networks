AI Learning Resources for Beginners provided by NaturalDialect
My Journey into Generative AI & Transformer Networks

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and learning portfolio for my deep dive into the exciting fields of Generative AI and Transformer Networks. It currently contains foundational learning resources, notes, and theoretical overviews.

This is a living repository that will be updated as my skills progress from theory to practical, hands-on projects.
About This Repository

The goal of this repository is to document my journey by organizing key learning materials related to modern AI architectures.

Currently, the content is focused on the following key areas:

    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Exploring the core concept of a generator-discriminator framework for generating new data, such as images.

    Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Understanding how these models encode data into a latent space and then decode it to generate new, similar data.

    Transformer Models: Delving into the revolutionary Transformer architecture, a key component of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) and a powerful tool for handling sequential data.

Repository Contents

    VAEs/: Learning resources, papers, and notes on Variational Autoencoders.

    GANs/: Materials dedicated to understanding Generative Adversarial Networks.

    Transformer_Models/: A collection of resources on the Transformer architecture and its key concepts like self-attention.

What's Next

As I continue my learning, this repository will evolve to include hands-on projects. Future plans include:

    A sentiment analysis project using a Transformer-based model.

    Implementing a basic text generation model to create new sentences.

    Building a project to generate images using a generative model.
